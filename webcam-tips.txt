How to tell if your webcam has been hacked
Check the webcam indicator light:  Is it on, even though you aren’t using the webcam? This could be a sign of a hacked webcam, or it could be connected to a browser extension.

Check your open apps and browser extensions, deactivating one at a time to find a potential suspect.

Then, see if your webcam process is running — if it is, reboot your device to check if your webcam activates automatically. Any sign of unauthorized use could mean that you have a hacked webcam.

If the process isn’t running, try activating the webcam yourself. Do you receive an error message stating that it’s already in use? Don’t rely on the indicator light as a foolproof signal — these lights can be configured to remain off even when the webcam is in use. Many webcam hackers will do just this.

Look for saved audio and video recordings in your webcam folder. If you find any that you didn’t record yourself, you might have a hacked webcam.

Use a tool such as Avast Hack Check to determine whether your email address and any other accounts that use it have been compromised in a data breach. A hacker who has your login credentials can worm their way into your personal accounts and/or devices.
